# **Ark API PowerShell Module**

All-in-one module to access all Ark network functions using PowerShell in Windows 7, 8, 10 and Windows Server 2008R2, 2012, 2016. This module will include integrated Help and Examples in v1.0.  It's a "Work In Progress" toward v1.0. It's very incomplete compared to full Ark API possibilities ...

## **Extra Scripts**

I included some examples usage scripts in the `Scripts` sub-directory of the archive.

## **Text Based Documentation**

For thoses who prefer using text files documentation, I auto-generated it and included it in the `Documentation` sub-directory of the archive.

## **Troubleshooting & Common Error(s)**

**It doesn’t work.**

Verify PowerShell version installed in your computer. Execute the following command:

> $PSVersionTable

The PSVersion must be at least v4.x.
If not, go [HERE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40855), select your language, download, install and reboot.

When done re-run the test to confirm your version is now v4.x or upper.

**Script work but communication with server fail.**

Verify the configuration of the server (config.json) to allow your IP address in the whitelist section. Don’t forget to restart your Ark client to update the configuration.

**Script is asking confirmation to execute when running it.**

> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
